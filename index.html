          <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
          <p>I have an interest in IT as it just makes sense to me. I enjoy playing games, writing code and learning something new.
            My interest began as a kid when we got our first family computer. I was always on it. Mostly playing games at that age.
            It grew from there when I become more interested in what my Dad was doing as he was working as an IT engineer. When I left
            school, I enrolled in Tafe to become a network engineer so I could follow in my dad's footsteps. I have now been working in
            IT for the last 10 years across 4 different jobs. Have spent the last 9 years on 2 separate support desks. This has given me
            experience in IT and good exposure to different technologies. My current job has given me more experience in software development,
            which is where I see my career going.<br>
            <br>
            I chose RMIT after discussing my options with an advisor with Open Universities. RMIT had a course that suited me more as it is
            tailored to becoming a software developer. The subjects also got me excited to choose this course as it was going to give me the necassary
            learning and insights to achieve my goal. <br>
            <br>
            I expect to learn best practices when coding. How to work effectively in a team. Fundamentals with different programming languages.
            I also expect to learn everything that will allow me to get my first job as a software developer.

          <p> I think some of the results are pretty accurate while some areas I am not totally sure that is me.
            I am introverted and quite happy to spend time alone but quite comfortable socialising with others.
            Not everything about an Adventurer is me. While I can get restless sitting at times and need to do things,
            I am also quite content to do nothing at times and completely recharge. I feel the idea of the career path for
            an Adventure of needing more than just a job is me. I need to be doing something that doesn't just keep me busy
            but makes good use of my skills and expertise but also allows me prove myself. <br>
            <br>
            While I know I am not creative enough to paint a masterpiece, I have enough creativity to be able to find
            solutions to problems which the creativity test lends itself to.
            The learning test also confirmed that I learn best from listening which my previous study from reading a
            book and trying to follow has resulted in a failed test.<br>
            <br>
            Overall, the tests do represent how my personality, learning style and my creativity pretty well. <br>
            <br>
            My influence won’t be the leader that everyone looks to for the direction we go but the team player
            that will help come up with and develop the solutions. With being an adventurer, I will look for ways
            to do something and share this with my team.<br>
            <br>
            When forming teams, we need to ensure we don’t have the same traits amongst all members of the team.
            We can’t have all adventurers that are introverted. A good team has a good balance of extroverted people
            to introverted people, more creativity people to less creativity people.

    <!-- Project Idea Section -->

        <div class="idea" id="project">
          <h2>Project Idea</h2>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>This project is to develop and building a navigation application linked to
            earbuds with built-in cameras for the visually impaired. The application will
            be able to guide the user to a location with voice directions but also advise
            how to avoid an object as well as assistance with boarding trains and buses.
            The application will also be able map new locations such as houses, apartments
            and public buildings. Application will be voice activated and configured to accept
            only the hosts voice.
          </p>
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>The motivation behind this project is to develop artificial intelligence that will
            benefit the visually impaired. It is estimated that there is over 575,000 people who
            are blind or visually impaired. While there has been massive in roads in technology
            for the blind, I feel there is still a long way to go in bridging the gap of what is
            currently available and what is possible that will allow the blind to navigate this
            world as a non-visually impaired person can. The day where you cannot tell someone
            walking next to you is blind is something we should be striving for.
          </p>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>This project will develop a mobile application that will link to earbuds that have
            multiple cameras in each earbud. The application will use the phones built-in navigation
            to determine location and guide the user to their destination. With the multiple cameras
            in the earbuds, the application will be able to determine what is an object in front of
            them that the user needs to navigate around but also what is to their left and right as well
            as behind them. If public transport is required, the user will be guided to where the train
            doors or bus door is, and which is an available seat.<br>
            <br>
            The application will be able to map out the floor plan of houses, apartments and public buildings.
            This will allow for the user to be guided to bathrooms when visiting friends, and other rooms. The
            floor plans will be saved for future use.<br>
            <br>
            The application will be voice activated and mapped to the users’ voice; this will prevent the application
            from picking up any other voices when in crowded places.<br>
            <br>
            As the application learns, the user’s regular appointments and destinations will be stored and be able
            to automatically trigger based on the devices date and time and direct the user. Calendar integration
            will allow for automatic navigation for appointments with a location.<br>
          </p>
          <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
          <p>While the application will be built from scratch, the earbuds will be technologically advanced.
            Flexible solar panels will encase both earbuds, ensuring the user never loses power. There will also
            be major work on developing cameras that are small enough to keep the weight down without compromising
            build strength.
          </p>
          <h3>Skills Required </h3>
          <p>For this project, proficient skills in programming will be required to create the basis of
            the application. There will also be efficiency in machine learning algorithms required to
            develop means for the application to learn what an object is, how to avoid objects and how to account
            for moving objects. Experience in engineering design as well as manufacturing the earbuds will also be needed.
            Experience with solar power is essential for developing the solar panals that will encompass
            the earbuds for charging.
          </p>
          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>When completed, further independence will be available to the visually impaired with users
            of the application being able to navigate the world without the assistance of others. The
            concepts of the application and multiple cameras could open the door to expanding the
            application to allowing a visually impaired person to drive. Although this idea would
            make the Guide Dogs associations’ work in training dogs to see for the visually impaired
            redundant, it could open the path for the association to change direction and work with
            them in developing the application further with the hardware only available for sale
            through the Guide Dogs Association.
