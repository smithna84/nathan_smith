          <h2>Profile</h2>
          <p>I have an interest in IT as it just makes sense to me. I enjoy playing games, writing code and learning something new.
            My interest began as a kid when we got our first family computer. I was always on it. Mostly playing games at that age.
            It grew from there when I become more interested in what my Dad was doing as he was working as an IT engineer. When I left
            school, I enrolled in Tafe to become a network engineer so I could follow in my dad's footsteps. I have now been working in
            IT for the last 10 years across 4 different jobs. Have spent the last 9 years on 2 separate support desks. This has given me
            experience in IT and good exposure to different technologies. My current job has given me more experience in software development,
            which is where I see my career going.<br>
            <br>
            I chose RMIT after discussing my options with an advisor with Open Universities. RMIT had a course that suited me more as it is
            tailored to becoming a software developer. The subjects also got me excited to choose this course as it was going to give me the necassary
            learning and insights to achieve my goal. <br>
            <br>
            I expect to learn best practices when coding. How to work effectively in a team. Fundamentals with different programming languages.
            I also expect to learn everything that will allow me to get my first job as a software developer.
